<p class="subtitle">An open-source, highly experimental, non-custodial, privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet for desktop</p>

`Wasabito` is an attempt to completely redesign [Wasabi Wallet](http://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi) to make it reach it's full potential. As any other experiment its main
goal is to try *radical ideas* that cannot be implemented in the official mainstream wallet without risking the users base, breaking
backward compatibility or that could be extremely difficult/slow to reach consensus about.

## Radical idea

This is placeholder.
:::

The  [vision document](wasabito_vision) describes a bit more the conceptual changes proposed. While the  [tasks document](wasabito_tasks) goes 
a bit deeper in each of the modifications to be dones and the reasoning behind them.

[Research](wasabito_research) contains mostly implementation ideas to improve different aspects of the project.
