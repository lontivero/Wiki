This pages kees a log of the ideas I would like to work in in order to:

- Explore ways to optimize the credential  [dependency graph (WIP)](wasabito_dependency_graph). There is nothing concrete yes but lets continue thinking ;)

- Implement a peer-to-peer overlay layer for Wasabito with the idea to improve the  [network reliability](wasabito_network_reliability) and simplify the overall networking logic by replacing Tor by a  [network agnostic](wasabito_network_agnostic) network implementation

- Implement a more effective  [Denial of Service](wasabito_dos_protection) attack prevention mechanism

- Rethink the  [convenience of having two types of credentials](wasabito_kvac_unification) in comparison with having only one with two different attributes

- Analyze the strategy to  [improve the compact filters](wasabito_compact_filters)

- Analyze [coinjoin anonymity](knapsack)

- Reduce the need [Tor circuit negociations](tor_circuit_reduction) 

- Rethink  [Mempool hell](mempool-hell)
