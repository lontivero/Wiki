Wasabito have to be **FREE**. The coordinator shouldn't take any fees for coordination because this is the way to bring coinjoins to everybody. 
Each coordinator could implement it own policy. I can imagine private coordinators running in private networks available
for members only, plain fees or no fees at all.

A coordinator should be able to run in low resources machines, even with pruned bitcoin nodes, so **running a coordinator 
should be cheap**.
