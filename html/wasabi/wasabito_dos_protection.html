<h1 id="whats-a-denial-of-service-attack">What’s a Denial of Service
attack?</h1>
<p>A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is an attack meant to prevent the
provision of a given service. A very complete explanation of the subject
is available in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">wikipedia</a>
but there are a very few concepts that are important to have in
mind.</p>
<h1 id="types-of-dos-attacks">Types of DoS attacks</h1>
<p>Lets start by saying that there are two main kind of DoS attack that
a <strong>centralized</strong> coordinator should try to mitigate:</p>
<h2
id="distributed-denial-of-service-attacks-transport-layer">(Distributed)
Denial of Service Attacks (@ Transport Layer)</h2>
<p>This is by far the most common type of attack and consists on a
flooding the target with traffic. Given it is generally speaking a
transport layer attack, it is generic attack that can be performed using
general-use tools.</p>
<p>It is also a cheap attack that is provided as a service by criminal
groups who control botnets. That means that anyone can pay for attacking
any server and it doesn’t require to have any kind of knowledge.</p>
<p>Its <strong>generic</strong> nature allows the system adminitrator to
mitigate it using <strong>generic</strong> infrastructure meassures like
a firewall.</p>
<h2
id="specialized-denial-of-service-attacks-application-layer">Specialized
Denial of Service Attacks (@ Application Layer)</h2>
<p>This is the kind of attack that can be performed only by those who
understand how the system works and are motivated to invest time and
knowledge to design an attack for disrupting one specific target. It can
be achieved by reviewing the code and find programming errors or simply
by understanding the dynamics of the system.</p>
<p>By its <strong>specialized</strong> nature it requires the
application to be designed with attacks in mind and to implement
counter-meassures that can mitigate the impact of such attacks. This is
the type of attack that we want to discuss here.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-attack-wasabi">How to attack Wasabi</h1>
<p>It is necessary to understand how Wasabi can be attacked in order to
implement the prevention mechanism; otherwise how could we possible know
what to design for?</p>
<h2 id="do-not-sign">Do not sign</h2>
<p>The most obvious attack consists registering a coin for participating
in a coinjoin but refuse to sign the coinjoin transaction. This can be
repeated as many times as coins you have, in fact, each coin can be used
to attack twice.</p>
<p>This attack is the simplest one because it doesn’t require any real
technical/programming knowledge, or at least not at senior level. It is
also an attack for free because it doesn’t affect the attacker balance
at all.</p>
<p>The good news is that <code>Wasabi 2</code> is not specially
vulnerable to this naïve attack because:</p>
<ul>
<li>it bans the offending coin,</li>
<li>it runs a blame round with the remaining <code>whitelisted</code>
coins,</li>
<li>it runs many rounds in parallel,</li>
<li>it runs rounds frequently (In WW 1 this was nto the case)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="spend-the-participating-coin">Spend the participating coin</h2>
<p>Another trivial attack is simply to register a coin for participating
in a coinjoin but spending it before the coordination process finishes.
In this case it is possible to disrupt a round but at least it is not
for free, given the attacker has to pay the network fee.</p>
<div class="Note">
<p>Before continuing let me say that <code>Wasabi 2</code> allows users
to spend the registered coin without needing to unregister them first
because in case the coordinator detects one participating coin has been
spent, it simple removes that coin from the round except in the case of
being in the critical phase (signing). This improves the reliability of
the rounds by shortening the window of time that can be used to disrupt
the round.</p>
</div>
<p>It is still possible to spend the coin in two critical moments:</p>
<h3 id="spend-during-signing-phase">Spend during signing phase</h3>
<p>Once the client is notified the round phased changed to signing phase
it can sign the coinjoin transaction and the spend coin. In fact, in
order to maximize the effectiveness of the attack the attacker client
can wait until enough peers have signed before executing spending:
otherwise it could happen that she self spends her participating coin
but someone else failed to sign and then she would have paid to disrupt
a round that would have never happened anyway. Note that in this case it
will not disrupt the blame round neither because it will be removed from
the <code>whitelist</code> as soon the coordinator
<code>input registration</code>.</p>
<h3 id="spend-after-transaction-broadcasted">Spend after transaction
broadcasted</h3>
<p>The attacker can sign the coinjoin transaction and perform
high-frequency requests to the wabisabi’s <code>status</code> endpoint
to see when <strong>all</strong> the required signatures have been
provided and when that happens (the coinjoin transaction is
completed/can be broadcasted) the attacker that previously connected to
a big number of bitcoins nodes in the network can broadcast a
transaction that spends the participating coin.</p>
<p>In this case, as well as in the previous one, it is the bitcoin
network the one that will reject the broadcasted coinjoin
transaction.</p>
<h3 id="partial-conclusion">Partial conclusion</h3>
<p>Spending the participating coin is a simple and effective DoS attack
against Wasabi that is <strong>even in its basic form quite
cheap</strong> in terms of the amount of bitcoins required to perform it
(5000 sats).</p>
<div class="Note">
<p>As any specialized attack, it can be cheap in terms of the amount of
bitcoins required but expensive in terms of the effort/knowledge the
attacker must invest and the opportunity cost that that represent. This
is IMO the reason why we have never seen an attack of this kind.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="what-other-are-doing">What other are doing</h3>
<p>This kind of attacks affect most multiparty transactions and
specially lightning (see: <a
href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-June/020557.html">Playing
with full-rbf peers for fun and L2s security</a>) There have been many
discussion about supporting <strong>full-rbf</strong> a-la Bitcoin Knots
so, the transaction that is minded is simply the one that pays more.
That would allow coordinators to compete against attackers by fee or
inflict them a greater economic damage.</p>
<h2 id="banning-offening-coins">Banning offening coins</h2>
<p>The general approach to prevent <strong>future</strong> disruptions
by the same actor is by banning the coin used in the attack. Of course
it is important to be able to identify which coin was used, that’s the
first thing to do:</p>
<table style="width:100%;">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 23%" />
<col style="width: 21%" />
<col style="width: 16%" />
<col style="width: 38%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Type</th>

<tr class="odd">

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div class="Alert">
<p>As we can see there are <strong>two</strong> attack vectors we are
not even detecting!</p>
</div>
<h3 id="to-ban-the-offender">To ban the offender</h3>
<p>In case of detecting an attack (or a misbehaving coin), depending on
the type of conduct it is involved (see table above) we<br />
have to ban it in order to prevent that coin from continue participating
in next rounds.</p>
<p>In some cases like those in which the coin failed to sign it could
convenient to ban the coin but give an opportunity to its
descendants.</p>
<h3 id="to-ban-the-offender-and-all-its-descendants">To ban the offender
and all its descendants</h3>
<p>However, in other cases it could worth to consider banning
<code>n</code> future generations so, even if an attacker self spends
the offending coin to continue attacking the rounds, those new coins
will be already considered invalid to participate.</p>
<p>This mechanism requires to check all future transaction and see if at
least one banned coin is being spent by it and in case that’s the case
then ban all the outputs of that transaction (this is how Wasabi 1
works)</p>
<h3 id="how-long-to-ban">How long to ban</h3>
<p>The <code>severity</code> of the penalty should take into account the
type of infringement, the reinsidence and the amount involved.</p>
